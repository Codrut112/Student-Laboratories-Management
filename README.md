# Student-Laboratories-Management
I created the 'Student Laboratories Management' project in Python, which enables users to manage and track student grades for laboratories. The project implements essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and provides various filtering options. It follows object-oriented programming principles(Encapsulation, Data Abstraction), utilizes unit testing, employs a layered architecture, adheres to GRASP (General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns) principles, and is developed with a focus on Test-Driven Development (TDD). Data is persistently stored in files, ensuring modularity and reusability in the codebase.
